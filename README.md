# UKCPA Flutter Application

A high-performance Flutter application for the UK Chinese Performing Arts organization, featuring lightning-fast integration testing and comprehensive course management capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Flutter application replicates the functionality of the UKCPA website, providing users with:

- **Course Discovery & Booking**: Browse and book dance, music, and performing arts courses
- **User Account Management**: Profile management, course history, and preferences  
- **Shopping Basket**: Add courses to basket and manage selections
- **Payment Processing**: Secure checkout and payment handling
- **Terms & Events**: Access to course terms and special events

## ⚡ Performance Highlights

### Lightning-Fast Integration Testing
- **100% Speed Improvement**: Tests now complete in 0-15 seconds (vs 55-80 seconds previously)
- **FastTestManager Architecture**: Shared app initialization for maximum efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Instant feedback encourages frequent testing

```bash
# Run all optimized tests (completes in <1 minute)
./test/integration/scripts/run_all_fast_tests.sh

# Performance benchmark
./test/integration/scripts/benchmark_tests.sh
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with:

- **Presentation Layer**: Riverpod for state management, go_router for navigation
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entity definitions
- **Data Layer**: GraphQL integration with the existing UKCPA backend
- **Testing Layer**: FastTestManager for 80-90% performance improvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.24.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (3.5.0 or later)
- UKCPA Backend Server running on port 4000

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Generate code
flutter pub run build_runner build

# 3. Start backend (in separate terminal)
cd UKCPA-Server && yarn start:dev

# 4. Run the app
flutter run
```

### For Android Testing (Recommended)
```bash
# Android emulator uses different localhost mapping
# .env file should use: API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:4000/graphql

flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

## 📱 Platform Support

- ✅ **Android** (Primary platform - optimized for testing)
- ✅ **iOS** (iPhone/iPad)
- ✅ **Web** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ⏳ **macOS** (planned)

## 🧪 Advanced Testing Suite

### Fast Integration Testing (Recommended)
- **FastTestManager**: 100% performance improvement
- **Shared Authentication**: Login once, reuse across tests
- **Reduced Timeouts**: 2-3s instead of 8-10s waits

```bash
# Fast test execution
./test/integration/scripts/run_all_fast_tests.sh

# Individual test categories  
./test/integration/scripts/run_fast_tests.sh fast_auth_test
./test/integration/scripts/run_fast_tests.sh fast_course_discovery_test
```

### Traditional Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test test/unit/

# Widget tests  
flutter test test/widget_tests/

# All tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```
