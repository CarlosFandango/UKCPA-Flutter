## 🏗️ Course Details Tests - NOT COMPLETED

**Status:** Tests created but not executed due to timeout issues in course discovery tests.

**Expected Functionality:**
- Navigate to individual course details pages
- Display course basic information (title, description, instructor)
- Show course session information (schedule, times, dates)
- Display pricing information
- Provide booking functionality (Add to Basket, Book Now)
- Handle navigation back from course details

## 🐛 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ **RESOLVED: Network Connectivity** (WAS CRITICAL - NOW FIXED)
- **Issue:** Android emulator couldn't connect to localhost:4000
- **Root Cause:** localhost in Android emulator refers to emulator, not host machine
- **Solution:** Changed API_URL from `localhost:4000` to `10.0.2.2:4000`
- **Result:** All GraphQL authentication now working properly
- **Evidence:** 
  ```
  🐛 Login successful for user: 123
  🐛 Auth token saved successfully  
  🐛 User data cached successfully
  ```

### 2. **Test Isolation Problem** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Login state doesn't persist between individual tests  
- **Impact:** Each test reinitializes the app, requiring re-login
- **Status:** Still present but less critical now that login works
- **Solution Needed:** Implement proper test state management

### 3. **Screenshot Functionality Limited** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** `Bad state: Call convertFlutterSurfaceToImage() before taking a screenshot`
- **Impact:** Visual validation not available
- **Note:** Expected on Android emulator but reduces test evidence

### 4. ✅ **RESOLVED: Post-Login Navigation** (WAS CRITICAL - NOW WORKING)
- **Issue:** After successful login, expected screen elements not found
- **Status:** FIXED - Navigation now working properly
- **Evidence:** Tests now successfully navigate to "Welcome to UKCPA" home screen
- **Post-login elements found:** "Browse Courses", "Home", "Courses", "Basket", "Account"

## 🔍 Raw Test Evidence

### Authentication Test Sample Output:
```
🔧 Initializing UKCPA app for automated testing...
✓ Environment variables loaded
✓ Hive storage initialized  
✓ App widget pumped
✓ App initialization completed
🔍 Verifying app is in testable state...
✅ App is in expected testable state: login
📝 Entering text in field with key [<'email-field'>]: "test@ukcpa.com"
✓ Text entered successfully
👆 Tapping button "Sign In"
🐛 Attempting login for email: test@ukcpa.com
🐛 Adding UKCPA site ID header to GraphQL request
```

### Course Discovery Test Evidence:
```
✅ Test completed successfully: should login and navigate to course discovery
❌ Test failed: should display course list
Expected: no matching candidates
Actual: Found 1 widget with text "Sign in to your account"
Should be logged in before testing course discovery
```
