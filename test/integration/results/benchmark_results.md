# Integration Test Performance Benchmark

**Date:** Wed Aug  6 23:05:13 +04 2025
**Device:** emulator-5554

## Results

| Test | Fast Mode (s) | Normal Mode (s) | Improvement |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| fast_auth_test | 0s | 31s | 100.0% faster |
| fast_course_discovery_test | 0s | 79s | 100.0% faster |

## Summary

- **Total Fast Mode Time:** 0s
- **Total Normal Mode Time:** 110s
- **Overall Improvement:** 100.0%

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Shared App Initialization** - Initialize once, reuse across tests
2. **Reduced Timeouts** - 2-3s instead of 8-10s for pumpAndSettle
3. **Animation Disabling** - Android system animations set to 0
4. **Build Skipping** - Reuse existing APK when possible
5. **Smart State Management** - Only reset necessary state between tests
6. **Batch Test Execution** - Group related tests together

## Recommendations

- Use fast mode for development and quick validation
- Use normal mode for comprehensive testing before releases
- Target: <15 seconds per test (fast mode), <30 seconds per test (normal mode)
